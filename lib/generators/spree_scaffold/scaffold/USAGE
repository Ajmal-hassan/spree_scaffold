		It also creates an initializer that insert an admin menu item for the model you created

	    app/views/admin/model_names/index.html.erb
	    app/views/admin/model_names/new.html.erb
	    app/views/admin/model_names/edit.html.erb
	    app/views/admin/model_names/_form.html.erb
	    db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_create_model_names.rb
	    config/locales/en_model_names.yml
